If it&amp;#39;s a), you&amp;#39;ll stay with this bike for years -- basically until it either fails catastrophically or you stop riding completely.

This is where MOST mountain bikers should stay.  For $1500, you get a GREAT bike that can handle far more than you can dish out.

Nearly all of my records have sentimental value for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: THE STORY&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. The fire started in bastrop, which about 25 minutes east of austin.  I was in san antonio visiting at the time. I got the call that our neighborhood was being evacuated as the state park, and neighborhoods to the northeast of that were already on fire. This ended up being the biggest wildfire in Texas&amp;#39;s recorded history. Over a thousand homes were lost. &lt;a href=\"http://digitaltexan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bastrop-fire-map.jpg\"&gt;this is a fire damage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening. Helpless, I called my roommate who was on the way home from work in austin. He didn&amp;#39;t know yet. I told him about the evacuation. They were not letting people into the neighborhood now... just getting them out. I told him about a way I know through the forest. He parked at the hospital and followed the deer trail/path of least resistance I had discovered by walking home from work one day. He made it to the house, got our guitars and his dog, hopped on his bike, rode out of the neighborhood and down the highway back to his car. My dog was with me in san an, thankfully. Police were driving around with their loudspeakers evacuating everyone. He goes and stays at a friend&amp;#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut to sunday morning. I&amp;#39;m feeling wretched. If I don&amp;#39;t try to get back, I will regret it forever. I had bought the mountain bike i had been saving up for for months on saturday afternoon. I strapped my bike to my car and headed for bastrop... about an hour and half away from where I was in san an. My roommate had to work, my girlfriend kept my dog in san an so this was a solo mission. As I got close, it looked like armageddon. seriously just fucking crazy. I&amp;#39;ll post pictures here after this, if anyone is interested. Anyways, the highway was closed at the hospital as I had suspected. I parked at the hospital and hopped on my bike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 to 15 minutes later, I make it to the house. The neighborhood was like 28 days later... just completely barren. The fire was to my east. I got in the door and was shaking with adrenaline. My heart was racing. The first thing thing i did was grab my camel bak and filled it up with ice and water (brita). I should mention that all the power and water had been turned off by this point. I grabbed a big duffel bag that was filled with clothes I longer wear and dumped them on my bed. I then opened my record chest and began packing them into the duffel. I emptied my backpack on the floor and began stuffing records in there. I went to my roommates room and grabbed some photos off the wall and his camera in its back. I then realized that I&amp;#39;m terrible at the &amp;quot;what would you grab in a fire scenario&amp;quot; so i figured I better get out of there. I strapped everything on my shoulders and walked my bike outside. Fuck, it was so heavy. The duffel bag, camelbak, backpack, camera bag. It was incredibly awkward. Bastrop is in the hill country, so my neighborhood street looks like a roller coaster. By the time I made it to the front entrance of my neighborhood I laid down my bike and unloaded my shoulders. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack with all the adrenaline, the up and down ride with the weight on my shoulders. It took me about 20 minutes to catch my breath. I loaded up again and rode to my car down the highway. I was filmed by a lot of bystanders riding out of my neighborhood with all the stuff on my shoulders. I emptied the bags into my car (which was park in the shade and not too hot). I loaded the empty bags up and hit the forest again. Repeat that whole adventure once more. I figured that would be it for me, and I didn&amp;#39;t think that the fire would actually make it to our house.  Then my phone died. Not wanting to move my car, I rode my bike all the way into town to wal mart, and picked up a mobile charger. Rode back to my car and charged up. Bystanders were just stopped on the highway and hundreds of people were just helplessly watching in horror and shock.  By this time, I just wanted to know how that house was so back in the forest I went. Made it to the house and the choppers were now flying directly over my house on their route to drop water and solution. That was really scary. On the way out the third time, i took the way back through the forest instead of the front of the neighborhood. This includes a downhill dirt road. I ate shit. just completely busted my ass. Luckily I didnt break anything, but I scraped my knee up really badly. I made it to the car, caught my breath and then rode to my office to see if it was on fire as smoke was coming from that direction . It was fine so I went in, and refilled my camelbak. Rode back to my car at the hospital and loaded up. I just sat and stared at the smoke after that. The hospital is directly to the right off the highway &lt;a href=\"http://99dzh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/t1larg.bastrop.fire_.raci_.jpg\"&gt;in this picture&lt;/a&gt; across the street from the super 8. Not my picture. I&amp;#39;m on my work computer right now. About a half hour later, I left and headed back to san an. I was completely depleted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I moved to a hotel room in austin with my coworkers and we set up a temporary office in hotel so we could be operational. We have a web based business. I anxiously waited for any news on our house and whole area as updates happened. I found out my house had been confirmed gone on thursday. My efforts totally paid off. It was the craziest experience of my life. I&amp;#39;m still in a hotel in austin, and re rentry to bastrop are happening this week. I will be in a hotel until i find a new place to live in austin. And thats the story. I apologize for any grammar or typos as I wrote this very fast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: MOBILE PHONE PICS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/ewxHZ\"&gt;approaching bastrop about 20 minutes out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/xZUo9\"&gt;back of the hospital where I parked looking at the woods I rode through, first trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/b5aIh\"&gt;my first load-fixed from before. was linked to wrong photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/3nNsG\"&gt;chopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/eqwGC\"&gt;back of the hospital after I got back from the first trip. notably worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/HifDW\"&gt;view from the front of the hospital after returning from first trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/A0zlT\"&gt;seeing the smoke through the trees from my balcony, second trip to the house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/Kpzt1\"&gt;last photo taken of my room after I loaded up, second trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/CbLNh\"&gt;front of my house on the way out from the second trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/hgRGZ\"&gt;front of my house, alternate view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/1FKm0\"&gt;taken just down the road. the fire has gotten super close. this is when I realized we may be in serious danger of losing the house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/Ypxcm\"&gt;my house after the fact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/cegoB\"&gt;my doorstep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/vnnhI\"&gt;this was my fridge, dryer, and washer machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It took three insanely intense trips... but I managed to save all of them.

It&amp;#39;s all worked out now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we should consider that flair is not necessarily a good thing. &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ihd0m/moderators_looking_for_feedback_on_giving_users/c23rxd3\"&gt;One redditor argues&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;quot;one of the best features about Reddit is the lack of avatars/signatures/coloured names and all that other stuff that wastes space on regular forum software. It means that the username is unimportant - your eyes are drawn straight to the message, and everyone is equal in a way.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/kmvjc/could_rbicycling_get_flags_like_rmtb_has_it_would/c2lq75a\"&gt;A bikeitor raises the possibility&lt;/a&gt; of elitism if users&amp;#39; bikes are flaunted via flair. There are more mundane issues like the simple fact that location-specific flags are only as useful as your knowledge of world flags is comprehensive, and flair will probably make the page layout feel more cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bearing these concerns in mind, I&amp;#39;ve tried to keep the flair relatively subtle. What I was thinking is that we can use &lt;strong&gt;flag icons to indicate your location&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;text field to describe your (favorite) bike&lt;/strong&gt;, such as you can see in my flair. (I&amp;#39;m theoretically open to discussion about this, except for the fact that once the ball is rolling in this direction, it will be tricky to change course.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The text field describing your bike is not in a rigid format, but info like &amp;quot;year make model type-of-bike&amp;quot; might be a good starting point. If you don&amp;#39;t know this info, just write whatever description you can come up with that seems appropriate (and concise). I and the other mods reserve the right to veto any text that we feel detracts or distracts from the community&amp;#39;s focus on bicycling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get flair:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a post in this thread, precisely following the format of the samples below. See note below about location abbreviations.

Thanks to many other reddit mods for leading the way in figuring out how flair works so that I could borrow from their example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I think y&amp;#39;all look quite sharp!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "    ********************************************************\n    * Ignore everything below this box.\n    * It is a legacy of how flair used to be done.\n    * Your flair is now easily managed by you!\n    * Look to the right.       \n    * See 'Show my flair on this reddit'? Make sure that is checked.\n    * Then click 'edit' and choose your location flag,\n    * and enter your bike in the text field at the bottom.\n    * Easy!\n    * Thanks to mod Stereo for implementing this!\n    ********************************************************\n\nHello /r/bikers!\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I'm trying to make this go smoothly for all 27,500 of us (especially me).\n\nIn response to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/kmvjc/could_rbicycling_get_flags_like_rmtb_has_it_would/) calling for flag icons for /r/bicycling, I spent much of the weekend bumbling through the world of CSS to figure out how to give y'all the flair that many of you crave. It's all worked out now.\n\nHowever, we should consider that flair is not necessarily a good thing. [One redditor argues](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ihd0m/moderators_looking_for_feedback_on_giving_users/c23rxd3) that \"one of the best features about Reddit is the lack of avatars/signatures/coloured names and all that other stuff that wastes space on regular forum software. It means that the username is unimportant - your eyes are drawn straight to the message, and everyone is equal in a way.\" [A bikeitor raises the possibility](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/kmvjc/could_rbicycling_get_flags_like_rmtb_has_it_would/c2lq75a) of elitism if users' bikes are flaunted via flair. There are more mundane issues like the simple fact that location-specific flags are only as useful as your knowledge of world flags is comprehensive, and flair will probably make the page layout feel more cluttered.\n\nBearing these concerns in mind, I've tried to keep the flair relatively subtle. What I was thinking is that we can use **flag icons to indicate your location** and a **text field to describe your (favorite) bike**, such as you can see in my flair. (I'm theoretically open to discussion about this, except for the fact that once the ball is rolling in this direction, it will be tricky to change course.)\n\nThe text field describing your bike is not in a rigid format, but info like \"year make model type-of-bike\" might be a good starting point. If you don't know this info, just write whatever description you can come up with that seems appropriate (and concise). I and the other mods reserve the right to veto any text that we feel detracts or distracts from the community's focus on bicycling.\n\n**How to get flair:** Make a post in this thread, precisely following the format of the samples below. See note below about location abbreviations. Note: you must hit 'enter' twice to produce separate lines, as required.\n\n**Sample Flair-Requests:**\n\n**********************\nbike:\n\n2003 Specialized Allez\n\nlocation:\n\nus-ca\n\nThe first four lines must appear in this precise format if you want both a bike description and a location flag. You may then write any comments down here below those first 4 lines. Like 'Wow, flair is awesome! I'm going to love my California state flag!\"\n\n***\n\nbike:\n\nDahon Mu-P8 folding bike\n\nlocation:\n\nde\n\nI'm allowed to make comments here, right? Yep! I love my folding bike because I can easily fold it up and take it on the train around Germany and the rest of Europe.\n\n***\n\nbike:\n\nSingle-speed mountain bike\n\nThis person has declined to state their location. That's fine; they'll just have a bike description and no flag.\n\n***\n\nlocation:\n\nus\n\nThis person from the USA is not giving a description of their bike, nor are they providing a specific state in the US. No problem, they'll just have a generic USA flag.\n\n***\n\n**End Sample Flair-Requests**\n\nYou need to follow this formatting precisely; sorry about that, but we have 27,500+ subscribers, and I need to be able to automate the process somewhat.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Finding your location abbreviation** (if you want a flag). All abbreviations should be typed in *lower case*. You can only have 1 flag.\n\n1. If you want a country flag, find your country's ISO-3166 abbreviation [here](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/country_names_and_code_elements.htm) and use that.\n\n2. If you want a USA state flag (sorry, no regional flags available for other countries), your abbreviation is simply \"us-xx\" where the \"xx\" is your standard state abbreviation. Ex.: us-ca (California), us-il (Illinois), etc.\n\n3. There are a few special cases. You can do: catalonia, england, europeanunion, scotland, wales, us-dc, us-pr, us-vi.\n\nI will periodically run a python script to upload your flair to reddit, so your request won't be enacted right away. Wait 24 hours before you start to worry it's not working.\n\nPhew!, I think that's everything. Enjoy your flair. :)\n\nThanks to [famfamfam.com](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/) for the country icons and [gotoquiz.com](http://www.gotoquiz.com/web-coding/) for the US state flags.
